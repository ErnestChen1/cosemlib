 * This file is an example of operating system specific  wrapper functions.
 * This version implements many of the functions internally, so it can be used
 * to fill in missing functions from the target system C libraries.
 *
 * Some of the functions are using standard C library calls in order to keep
 * this file in working condition to allow the functions to be tested on a
 * Linux target. Please note that OS_NO_C_LIB_DEFINES needs to be defined for
 * this file to work correctly. Note that these implementations are only
 * examples and are not optimized for speed.
